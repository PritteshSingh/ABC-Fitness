      <ul>
        <li><h2>Eat varied, colorful, nutritionally dense foods</h2><p><h3>Healthful meals and snacks should form the foundation of the human diet. A simple way to create a meal plan is to make sure that each meal consists of 50 percent fruit and vegetables, 25 percent whole grains, and 25 percent protein. Total fiber intake should be 25–30 grams(g) daily.<br> Eliminate trans fats from the diet, and minimize the intake of saturated fats, which has a strong link with the incidence of coronary heart disease.</h3></p></li>
        <li><h2>Choose the right amount of weight</h2><p><h3>The weight you choose to use should leave you at or near failure on your specified number of repetitions.<br>For example, if you’re performing a set of 10 repetitions, by the tenth repetition, you should be unable or nearly unable to perform another repetition. You should rarely have more than “two reps in the tank” by the end of a set if your goal is building muscle.</h3></p></li>
        <li><h2>Choose your exercises well</h2><p><h3>As mentioned, muscle building is specific to the muscle being worked. For example, to build bigger biceps, you need to perform exercises that work the biceps. This could be an isolated bicep exercise, such as a bicep curl, or a compound movement that uses the biceps, such as a pullup.<br>Compound movements like a barbell back squat effectively stimulate multiple large muscle groups in a single exercise and provide more functional movement for real-life activities. This leads to both more efficient workouts and more practical muscle strength.</h3></p></li>
        <li><h2>Eliminate liquid calories</h2><p><h3>It is possible to consume hundreds of calories a day by drinking sugar-sweetened soda, tea, juice, or alcohol. These are known as “empty calories” because they provide extra energy content without offering any nutritional benefits.<br>Unless a person is consuming a smoothie to replace a meal, they should aim to stick to water or unsweetened tea and coffee. Adding a splash of fresh lemon or orange to water can provide flavor.</h3></p></li>
        <li><h2>Measure servings and control portions</h2><p><h3>Eating too much of any food, even low-calorie vegetables, can result in weight gain. Therefore, people should avoid estimating a serving size or eating food directly from the packet. It is better to use measuring cups and serving size guides. Guessing leads to overestimating and the likelihood of eating a larger-than-necessary portion.</h3></p></li>

      <ul>
        <li><h2>Decide your target number of repetitions</h2><p><h3>Stimulating muscle growth requires performing weight training exercises with an amount of weight that only allows you to perform 1–20 repetitions.<br>In general, the repetition continuum states that weights you can only lift for a few repetitions tend to build more strength, weights you can lift for 6–12 repetitions tend to build more muscle, and weights you can lift for 12–20 repetitions tend to increase muscular endurance.</h3></p></li>
        <li><h2>Choose the right amount of weight</h2><p><h3>Self-monitoring is a critical factor in successfully losing weight. People can use a paper diary, mobile app, or dedicated website to record every item of food that they consume each day. They can also measure their progress by recording their weight on a weekly basis.<br> Those who can track their success in small increments and identify physical changes are much more likely to stick to a weight loss regimen.</h3></p></li>
        <li><h2>Engage in regular physical activity and exercise</h2><p><h3>Regular exercise is vital for both physical and mental health. Increasing the frequency of physical activity in a disciplined and purposeful way is often crucial for successful weight loss.<br>One hour of moderate-intensity activity per day, such as brisk walking, is ideal. If one hour per day is not possible, the Mayo Clinic suggests that a person should aim for a minimum of 150 minutes every week.</h3></p></li>
        <li><h2>Structure your workout to avoid overtraining</h2><p><h3>A good rule of thumb is to perform 3 sets of 3–5 compound movements, followed by 3 sets of 1–2 isolation movements per workout.<br>Generally, you do your heaviest sets using compound movements and perform higher repetition ranges on your isolation movements.<br>Assuming you’re performing three working sets per exercise, limit your total combined compound and isolation movement exercises to 5–7 movements per workout.<br>This allows you to benefit from each type of exercise while maximizing the overall muscle building potential of your training program and avoiding any symptoms of overtraining.</h3></p></li>
        <li><h2>Calories needed to gain muscle</h2><p><h3>For sustainable muscle gain without excess fat gain, you want to eat 300–500 calories per day above your baseline needs.<br>Many factors affect your baseline calorie needs, also known as your total daily energy expenditure, or TDEE. These factors include your age, sex, current lean body mass, physical activity, occupation, and underlying medical conditions.</h3></p></li>
